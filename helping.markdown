## We would love your help

The Mill Road Winter Fair is a completely volunteer organised event. We aren't funded by the council, we're just a bunch of enthusiasts who keep the ball rolling.

To register your interest in becoming a committee member or even signing up as steward for next year, fill in the [Volunteer Expression of Interest Form](https://www.millroadwinterfair.org/volunteering/).

### Helping On The Day

* Stewarding: We have filled all our spots for 2019 (thank you to everyone who signed up!) but if you want to get ahead of the game you can register for next year, by filling in [this form](https://www.millroadwinterfair.org/volunteering/). By stewarding, you will be an integral part of this wonderful event that showcases Mill Road's amazing community and culture

* Support: If you applied too late to get the stewarding briefing there's still roles we can find for you. Any time you can offer will help lighten everyone else's load

### Organising

This whole thing is organised by a small handful of enthusiastic volunteers who meet up once or twice a month to coordinate our efforts.

If you would like to be a member of the committee, or just lighten the load of one of the committee members, please get in touch with [volunteers@millroadwinterfair.org](mailto:volunteers@millroadwinterfair.org) who will gladly get the ball rolling

### Donating

The Mill Road Winter Fair is only made possible with the generous support of our sponsors and donors, a huge thank you to them all!

There will be collection buckets on the day, please give generously.

Personal donations mean so very much to us and we'd gladly accept anything you can spare to keep this wonderful fair going.
