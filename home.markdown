## MILL ROAD WINTER FAIR AGM

### Given the constraints generated by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, we have decided to cancel our Mill Road Winter Fair AGM and instead to carry out essential processes online. Fortunately we anticipate a relatively low turnover of Committee members this year so we are holding a simple online re-election process to mirror the voting system that would have taken place in person at the AGM. However, we do have a couple of Committee positions available and many more key volunteer roles, so please do have a [look at the list](https://www.millroadwinterfair.org/assets/doc/2020/volunteer-positions-needed-for-2020-fair.pdf) and get in touch via [volunteers@millroadwinterfair.org](mailto:volunteers@millroadwinterfair.org) if you are interested in finding out more.

### Minutes from last years AGM can be found [here](https://www.millroadwinterfair.org/assets/doc/2020/2019-AGM-minutes-and-reports.pdf), the reports of the [Chair](https://www.millroadwinterfair.org/assets/doc/2020/mrwf-2019-agm-chair-report.pdf), [Safety Officer](https://www.millroadwinterfair.org/assets/doc/2020/Splendid-Events-AGM-report.pdf) and [Treasurer (i.e. the accounts)](http://millroadwinterfair.org/assets/doc/2020/MRWF-Accounts-for-2019-FINAL-for-AGM-with-notes-SIGNED.pdf) are also available and we welcome your comments, complaints and suggestions, please email them to [info@millroadwinterfair.org](mailto:info@millroadwinterfair.org). We will respond individually to all that we receive.

### This years' Fair will be on Saturday 5th December and we look forward to a BIG community celebration with lots of people enjoying being very close together.

### Thank you for your support

## About the fair

Every year, on the first Saturday in December, Mill Road is transformed. People take over from cars, shopkeepers turn out and set up their stalls, and we provide spaces for local businesses and charities to sell crafts, gifts and refreshments all along the street. Interspersed with the stalls are buskers, circus performers, dancers, poets and storytellers to entertain and inspire.

The Winter Fair is run entirely by volunteers and we need your donations to help stage it every year. If you would like to get involved or donate we would very much appreciate it.
